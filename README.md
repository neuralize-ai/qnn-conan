# QNN Conan

Simply a Conan recipe for the QNN SDK for use with
[Edgerunner](https://github.com/neuralize-ai/edgerunner). Clone this repo and
run `conan create .` from the root directory of the project to make it
available locally before trying to use Edgerunner with QNN support.

> [!NOTE]
> I am no lawyer and I'm not sure to what extent the QNN binaries can be made
  publicly available. For this reason, I am not currently planning to publish this
  to Conan Center.
